No, author order will depend on your final report.\nDo I need to be registered at a course to participate? No, you can participate independently on your own. Participation from industry is especially welcome!\nI am a course instructor, how do I participate officially with my course? Many thanks for your participation! You can just drop us a mail (reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com) with details of your course, and we will list it on our website!\nI am a course instructor, can I forward my reviews on the reports of my class? Yes! If your course ends earlier than the submission deadline and you have already graded the assignments, you can directly send us the evaluations! Have your students submit their report in our OpenReview portal, and drop us a mail at reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com with the evaluations paired with the submission links.\nI am a student participant from a course, but I do not see my course listed? Please contact your course instructor or TA to send us a mail (reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com) to register your course.

Please consider sharing the word about the challenge to your peers in your company too!\nThis is all nice, but what do I gain from participating? You will first add to the knowledge of the original paper. Peer reviewed reports will be showcased on PapersWithCode and published in the ReScience Journal. Starting this year, we are partnering with NeurIPS conference to showcase the accepted papers as a poster session in the main conference. Please check the following announcement for details.\nWhere can I get GPUs to run experiments? Check the Resources tab for more information.\nCan I contact the authors? Yes! It is highly recommended to contact the authors of the paper you are reproducing, to clarify doubts and implementation details.\nHow do I contact the authors? You can send the authors mail directly to initiate a discussion. The contact details can be found on the paper, which is linked in the pdf of the paper which is available for each paper.\nHow do I get the code of the paper? You can either search the pdf of the paper for the code, or find the link to PapersWithCode page of the paper, which is usually updated with the publicly released code of the authors.\nHow much of the code am I allowed to use? There is no restriction on the extent of the original code you can use for the reproducibility effort.\nIs the submission double blind? Yes, the report to be submitted should be double blind.

You can find the style files of the report in this template.\nIs the Reproducibility Summary section of the report mandatory? Yes! You should use our style files and add the “Reproducibility Summary” in the first page of your report. Make sure this summary does not exceed the first page. Failure of adding this summary will result in desk rejection.\nDoes the Reproducibility Summary count towards the page limit? Yes, the Reproducibility Summary counts towards the total page limit (nine pages).\nWhen I am submitting the report, what should I write in the “Abstract” field? You should copy your Reproducibility Summary in the abstract field. You should add a line separator between sections, and ensure the summary is properly formatted.\nIf my report is selected, how do I submit to ReScience? Once your report is accepted, you will be required to submit the final draft by camera-ready deadline.

The submission is strictly double blind, any violation of this will lead to desk reject. The first page of your report must incorporate this summary template, which should consist of the following sections:\nScope of reproducibility: Briefly define the claim of the paper that you intend to tackle in this report Methodology: Briefly state the overall methodology used in your approach Results: Concisely state the results / findings of the reproducibility study What was easy: State which part of the reproducibility study was easy to do. What was difficult: State the difficulties that you encountered while performing the reproducibility study. You can find the Reproducibility Summary template here. The first page of the template is mandatory and you can organize the rest of the report as you deem fit. We have also released a recommended outline of the report which you can use to incorporate your findings. You can find the Reproducibility Summary template here. The first page of the template is mandatory and you can organize the rest of the report as you deem fit. We have also released a recommended outline of the report which you can use to incorporate your findings.\nSubmitting your report We will use the same OpenReview Portal to submit your Reproducibility projects. Click on “Add Reproducibility Challenge Report” to submit your work. In the field of “Paper URL”, paste the paper URL of the paper (from the appropriate conference proceedings). In the Abstract, copy paste the Reproducibility Summary from your report.\nPlease check Important Dates for the deadline for submission of your report. Your report should be of maximum 9 pages excluding references, in ReScience style format as specified in Reproducibility Summary template. You can also submit supplementary materials. Code submission is mandatory along with your supplementary materials.\nReviewing Criteria We will be selecting reports which present a clear, well motivated, and thorough reproducibility effort.
