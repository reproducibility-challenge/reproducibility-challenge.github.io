## List of Partner venues

You can choose to reproduce papers published in the calendar year of 2022 for the following venues:


## Preparing Your Report
You have to use the [Reproducibility Summary template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jsrfcqhsgxmn) for writing your reports. The submission is strictly double blind, any violation of this will lead to desk reject. The first page of your report must incorporate this summary template, which should consist of the following sections:

- _Scope of reproducibility_: Briefly define the claim of the paper that you intend to tackle in this report
Methodology: Briefly state the overall methodology used in your approach
- _Results_: Concisely state the results / findings of the reproducibility study
- _What was easy_: State which part of the reproducibility study was easy to do.
- _What was difficult_: State the difficulties that you encountered while performing the reproducibility study.
You can find the Reproducibility Summary template here. The first page of the template is mandatory and you can organize the rest of the report as you deem fit. We have also released a recommended outline of the report which you can use to incorporate your findings.

## Submitting your report
We will use the same OpenReview Portal to submit your Reproducibility projects. Click on “Add Reproducibility Challenge Report” to submit your work. In the field of “Paper URL”, paste the paper URL of the paper (from the appropriate conference proceedings). In the Abstract, copy paste the Reproducibility Summary from your report.

Please check Important Dates for the deadline for submission of your report. Your report should be of **maximum 9 pages** excluding references, in ReScience style format as specified in [Reproducibility Summary template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jsrfcqhsgxmn). You can also submit supplementary materials. **Code submission is mandatory** along with your supplementary materials.

## Reviewing Criteria

We will be selecting reports which present a clear, well motivated, and thorough reproducibility effort. The report should very briefly discuss the main ideas of the paper and not simply reiterate the main work. Your report should clearly mention the key findings of your effort, and if necessary include discussion / commentary / suggestions to the readers re-implementing this work on its replicability / complexity. Your report must contain the Reproducibility Summary in the first page as defined in the previous section.

Reports will be reviewed on the following criteria. You can also refer to the [reviewing criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9QROqGmR4D2ncEj_suVpDzkcd3zdUAaDDjwyep5QTc/edit?usp=sharing) used in MLRC 2021 for reference.
