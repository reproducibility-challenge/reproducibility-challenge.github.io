## Final decisions for MLRC 2023

We are now releasing
[the final list of decisions for MLRC 2023](/proceedings/#2023proceedingsmlrc2023).
This list includes the previous partial list published on July 5th, 2024. We
have given additional time to TMLR to complete the reviews, however it is
unfortunate that few papers are still awaiting a decision due to unresponsive
Action Editors from TMLR. As we need to wrap up this edition, we are proceeding
with the final list of 22 accepted papers. Congratulations to all!

If you are an author of the below mentioned papers and have not
[submitted the form](https://forms.gle/JJ28rLwBSxMriyE89) with the camera ready
items, please consider doing so at the earliest. We will reach out to the
accepted authors soon with the next steps. We will also announce the best paper
awards and share details on the logistics of NeurIPS poster session in the
coming weeks.

**Update, Sept 13th, 2024**: A couple of papers received acceptance status post
our final date of MLRC 2023 acceptance. We have now incorporated them too in the
final list.

## An update on decisions

_July 5th, 2024_

We initially communicated to have all decisions of MLRC 2023 out by 31st of
May, 2024. Unfortunately, several submissions are still under review at TMLR,
and we are waiting for the final decisions to trickle in. Overall, MLRC 2023 had
46 valid submissions, out of which we have recieved decisions on 61% of them. We
are in touch with TMLR to expedite the process of decisions for the remaining
submissions - we expect all decisions to come in by the next couple of weeks.

Until then, we are happy to announce the (partial) list of accepted papers.
Congratulations to all :tada:! If you are an author of the below mentioned
papers and have not [submitted the form](https://forms.gle/JJ28rLwBSxMriyE89)
with the camera ready items, please consider doing so at the earliest. We will
reach out to the accepted authors soon with the next steps.

In order for your paper to be submitted and presented at MLRC 2023, it first
needs to be **accepted and published** at TMLR. While TMLR aims to follow a
2-months timeline to complete the review process of its regular submissions,
this timeline is not guaranteed. If you haven’t already, we therefore recommend
submitting your original paper to TMLR by **February 16th, 2024**, that is a
little over 3 months in advance of the MLRC publication announcement date.

## Key Dates

- Challenge goes live: October 23, 2023
- Deadline to share your **intent to submit** a TMLR paper to MLRC: **February
  16th, 2024** at the following form: **https://forms.gle/JJ28rLwBSxMriyE89**.
  This form requires that you provide a link to your TMLR submission. Once it
  gets accepted (if it isn’t already), you should then update the same form with
  your paper camera ready details. Your accepted TMLR paper will finally undergo
  a light AC review to verify MLRC compatibility.
- We aim to announce the accepted papers by ~~**May 31st, 2024**~~ **July 17th,
  2024**, pending decisions of all papers.
