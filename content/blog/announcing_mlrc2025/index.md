We are excited to announce the 8th iteration of the Machine Learning
Reproducibility Challenge, MLRC 2025, which will also be the first, in-person
conference, hosted at Princeton University, New Jersey, USA on August 21st,
2025!

The Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge (MLRC) is an annual conference
for reproducibility research in the Machine Learning community. MLRC has been
running as an online conference for the last seven years
([v1](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2018-ReproducibilityChallenge.html),
[v2](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2019-ReproducibilityChallenge.html),
[v3](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/),
[v4](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/),
[v5](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2021),
[v6](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022), [v7](/proceedings/mlrc2023/)). This
limits the incentives to submit to the conference, as online mode doesn’t offer
the authors to showcase their work and network among researchers in the same
domain. We have been systematically trying to address this issue by
[improving the submission and publication process](/blog/announcing_mlrc2023/),
and partnering with several conferences over the years, either by a workshop, or
more recently through a
[Journal-to-Conference](https://blog.neurips.cc/2022/08/15/journal-showcase/)
mode with NeurIPS for the last couple of iterations.

The success of the MLRC poster sessions at these conferences, and the recent
success of [COLM](https://colmweb.org/index.html), motivated us to “graduate”
MLRC into an in-person conference, starting this iteration. MLRC 2025 will be a
one-day single track conference, with a mix of invited talks, oral
presentations, and poster sessions. We hope the conference will provide the much
needed avenue for discussing and disseminating reproducibility research and
allow participants and attendees to network over a common goal of improving the
science of Machine Learning through reproducible methods. We are excited to
partner with Princeton University, specifically the
[Princeton AI Lab](https://ai.princeton.edu/ai-lab) for providing us the venue,
and to [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/) for providing us the funds to
conduct such in-person conference.

As for the nomenclature of the conference, historically we have had one year
backdated, as in MLRC 2023 actually happens in 2024, due to incorporating papers
published in 2023. As we move on to be an in-person conference, to closer align
with the format of ML conferences and also in favor of broadening our scope, we
are therefore dropping the version 2024 and moving directly to MLRC 2025.

We therefore announce the [call for papers](/call_for_papers/) for MLRC 2025. We
invite submissions which conduct novel, unpublished research of reproducibility
of machine learning methods and literature, including but not limited to :

- Methods and tools to foster reproducibility research in Machine Learning
- Generalisability of published claims: novel insights and results beyond what
  was presented in the original paper, from any paper (or set of papers)
  published in top ML conferences and journals.
- Meta-reproducibility studies on a set of related papers.
- Meta analysis on the state of reproducibility in various subfields in Machine
  Learning.

Submissions must be first accepted at [TMLR](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/) to be
considered in the MLRC 2025 Proceedings. Please read the
[author guidelines](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/author-guide.html) and
[submission guidelines](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/editorial-policies.html) from TMLR
to get the submission format and to understand more about the reviewing process.
Existing papers related to the scope (with reproducibility certification)
already published at TMLR are also welcome for the consideration of the
committee.

While TMLR aims to follow a 2-months timeline to complete the review process of
its regular submissions, this timeline is not guaranteed. If you haven’t
already, we therefore recommend submitting your original paper to TMLR by
February 21st, 2025. We aim to announce the accepted papers by June 27th. We
have set a cutoff deadline for accepting TMLR decisions one week prior to the
announcement deadline, allowing ample time for you to ensure your paper has
received the decision at TMLR, and update our forms accordingly. For logistical
purposes, this date will be a hard deadline, and unfortunately we would not be
able to accommodate any late decisions from TMLR post this date. Therefore, we
encourage you to submit early to TMLR, and contact the TMLR Action Editors well
in advance if your paper hasn’t been reviewed or is pending decisions. If you
miss the cutoff deadline, we encourage you to still go through the TMLR review
cycle, as then your paper once published will be eligible for the next year's
iteration (MLRC 2026). If you already have a relevant published TMLR paper which
has not been showcased at MLRC 2023, you can directly submit it now to our
system for consideration for MLRC 2025.

## Important dates

- Submit to TMLR OpenReview: https://openreview.net/group?id=TMLR
- Deadline to share your intent to submit a TMLR paper to MLRC: **February 21st,
  2025** at the following form: https://forms.gle/REgwJQBP8ZXQEaJk7
- This form requires that you provide a link to your TMLR submission. Once it
  gets accepted (if it isn’t already), you should then update the same form with
  your paper camera ready details.
- Cutoff deadline for TMLR decisions: **June 20th, 2025**
- Deadline for announcing accepted papers: **June 27th, 2025**
- Conference day: **August 21st, 2025** at Princeton University, NJ, USA

In the following months, we will share more updates about the conference
session, invited talks, program and registration. We are excited that this will
be a first, in-person conference specifically focused on reproducibility in
machine learning research, which will foster the research and discussion on
reproducible methods, analysis, insights and further strengthen and promote the
scientific understanding of Machine Learning.

We are looking for co-organizers and volunteers! If you wish to help us in
organizing this in-person conference, or would like to nominate organizers /
volunteers, please
[submit the following form](https://forms.gle/w8MtswWEbBWQVZbEA). You can also
contact us at [mlrc-2025@googlegroups.com](mailto:mlrc-2025@googlegroups.com) or
reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com if you have any feedback / suggestions.

Looking forward to a successful conference next year!
