Typically we do allow it if the paper is published within a couple of years prior to the current scope of conferences. Although, before starting to work on it, please contact the organizers to confirm, as your request will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

**How many team members are allowed?**
Any number of team members are allowed.

Not at all, we encourage cross-institute participation! In that case, add the institutions of your team members in a comma separated format in the claims and report submission forms in OpenReview.

**Do I have to add team members based on author order?**
No, author order will depend on your final report.

Many thanks for your participation! You can just drop us a mail (reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com) with details of your course, and we will list it on our website!

**I am a course instructor, can I forward my reviews on the reports of my class?**
Yes! If your course ends earlier than the submission deadline and you have already graded the assignments, you can directly send us the evaluations! Have your students submit their report in our OpenReview portal, and drop us a mail at reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com with the evaluations paired with the submission links.

Please contact your course instructor or TA to send us a mail (reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com) to register your course. We will update the website periodically and add new courses.

Yes you are more than welcome to! Please consider sharing the word about the challenge to your peers in your company too!

**This is all nice, but what do I gain from participating?**
You will first add to the knowledge of the original paper. Peer reviewed reports will be showcased on PapersWithCode and published in the ReScience Journal. Starting this year, we are partnering with NeurIPS conference to showcase the accepted papers as a poster session in the main conference. Please check the following announcement for details.

**Where can I get GPUs to run experiments?**
Check the Resources tab for more information.

**Can I contact the authors?**
Yes! It is highly recommended to contact the authors of the paper you are reproducing, to clarify doubts and implementation details.

**How do I contact the authors?**
You can send the authors mail directly to initiate a discussion. The contact details can be found on the paper, which is linked in the pdf of the paper which is available for each paper.

**This is super exciting, how can I help?**
Thanks for your interest in our challenge! You can help out by spreading the news. If you are a course-instructor you can help by enrolling your course in the challenge. You can also sign up to be a reviewer when we share the call for reviewing for the challenge! If you are a company you can help sponsor by providing compute resources. Please contact us at reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com to list your generous offer in the Resources section.
