_MLRC follows
[Princeton Code of Conduct](https://rrr.princeton.edu/university-wide-regulations/12-university-wide-conduct-regulations)_

<!-- _MLRC utilizes [COLM Code of Ethics](https://colmweb.org/CoE.html), which itself -->
<!-- utilizes [ICLR Code of Ethics](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics), which is -->
<!-- restated here._ -->
<!---->
<!-- **Responsible Stewardship** The Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge -->
<!-- (MLRC) is committed to promoting good conduct and a reflexive and responsible -->
<!-- approach to research and its applications, especially with respect to research -->
<!-- and development related to reproducibility, methods, investigations and tools in -->
<!-- machine learning and artificial intelligence. This Code is a vital part of our -->
<!-- continuing effort to encourage reflection of the wider impacts of work that is -->
<!-- considered by the conference, and to encourage work that consistently supports -->
<!-- the responsible stewardship of trustworthy research that advances knowledge, -->
<!-- public good and well-being. -->
<!---->
<!-- **Aims** This Code of Ethics provides general ethical principles, applicable to -->
<!-- both individual researchers and to organizations that carry out, fund, host, or -->
<!-- are otherwise involved in research, and associated with COLM. The Code should -->
<!-- not be seen as prescriptive but as a set of principles to guide ethical, -->
<!-- responsible research. -->
<!---->
<!-- **Positive Action** This code applies to all contributors to MLRC, including -->
<!-- reviewers, authors, speakers, organizers of the conference, tutorials, -->
<!-- workshops, sponsors, and attendees. MLRC’s contributors are expected to -->
<!-- acknowledge this code, and whenever necessary, include a discussion in their -->
<!-- contributions that expands on the wider impacts of their work, using this Code -->
<!-- as one source of ethical considerations. -->
<!---->
<!-- ## General Ethical Principles -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Contribute to Society and to Human Well-being -->
<!---->
<!-- - Researchers must acknowledge that all people globally are stakeholders in -->
<!--   computing, and that we should use our skills for the benefit of society, its -->
<!--   members, and our natural environment. -->
<!-- - Research should minimize negative consequences, including threats to health, -->
<!--   safety, personal security, and privacy. In order to do so, it must take into -->
<!--   consideration a multiplicity of socio-economic factors and geographies. -->
<!-- - When the interests of multiple groups conflict, the needs of those less -->
<!--   advantaged should be given increased attention and priority. -->
<!-- - Researchers should consider whether the results of their efforts will respect -->
<!--   diversity, will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet social needs, -->
<!--   and will be broadly accessible. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Uphold High Standards of Scientific Excellence -->
<!---->
<!-- - Researchers and organizations should strive for excellence when conducting -->
<!--   research and aim to produce and disseminate work of the highest quality. This -->
<!--   implies a commitment to open enquiry, intellectual rigor, integrity, and -->
<!--   collaboration. -->
<!-- - Findings must be reported accurately and honestly. Researchers must not make -->
<!--   deliberately false or misleading claims, fabricate or falsify data, or -->
<!--   misrepresent results. Methods and results should be presented in a way that is -->
<!--   transparent and reproducible. -->
<!-- - Where human subjects are involved in the research process (e.g., in direct -->
<!--   experiments, or as annotators), the need for ethical approvals from an -->
<!--   appropriate ethical review board should be assessed and reported. -->
<!-- - All contributions to the research must be acknowledged, and agreements -->
<!--   relating to intellectual property, publication and authorship must be complied -->
<!--   with. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Avoid Harm -->
<!---->
<!-- - Here, "harm" means negative consequences. Well-intended actions, including -->
<!--   those that accomplish desired outcomes, may lead to harm. -->
<!-- - When that harm is unintended, those responsible are obliged to undo or -->
<!--   mitigate the harm as much as possible. Avoiding harm begins with engaging with -->
<!--   application domain experts, engagement with the communities that the research -->
<!--   is intended to serve, and a careful consideration of potential impacts on all -->
<!--   those affected. -->
<!-- - When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are -->
<!--   obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified. -->
<!-- - Harm to the natural environment, whether in the process of producing research -->
<!--   or in its application, should also be considered. In all cases, ensure that -->
<!--   all harm is minimized. -->
<!-- - The consequences of data aggregation and emergent properties of systems should -->
<!--   be carefully analyzed, including those that can become integrated into the -->
<!--   structure of society. Researchers have an additional obligation to report any -->
<!--   signs of system risks that might result in harm. For reporting, see the -->
<!--   section at the end on Concerns and Remediation. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Be Honest, Trustworthy and Transparent -->
<!---->
<!-- - Researchers should be honest about their qualifications, and about any -->
<!--   limitations in their competence to complete a task. -->
<!-- - Researchers should provide full disclosure of all pertinent system -->
<!--   capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties, -->
<!--   including any party that may deploy the system. -->
<!-- - Researchers should be open and transparent about any circumstances that might -->
<!--   lead to either real or perceived conflicts of interest or otherwise tend to -->
<!--   undermine the independence of their judgment. Researchers must consider their -->
<!--   competing interests, including from sources of the funding, and report any -->
<!--   possible conflicts. -->
<!-- - Researchers should not misrepresent work that might be competing or related, -->
<!--   and should not misrepresent an organization's policies or procedures. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Be Fair and Take Action not to Discriminate -->
<!---->
<!-- - The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and justice govern this -->
<!--   principle. The COLM Code of Conduct provides additional details of expected -->
<!--   behavior at the Conference. -->
<!-- - Fairness requires that even careful decision processes provide some avenue for -->
<!--   redress of grievances. -->
<!-- - Researchers should foster fair participation of all people—in their research, -->
<!--   at the conference and generally—including those of underrepresented groups. -->
<!-- - The use of information and technology may cause new, or enhance existing, -->
<!--   inequities. Technologies and practices should be as inclusive and accessible -->
<!--   as possible and researchers should take action to avoid creating systems or -->
<!--   technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Respect the Work Required to Produce New Ideas and Artifacts -->
<!---->
<!-- - Researchers must show respect for colleagues, research participants, society, -->
<!--   ecosystems, cultural heritage and the environment. -->
<!-- - Developing new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts -->
<!--   creates value for society, and those who expend this effort should expect to -->
<!--   gain value from and receive credit for their work. -->
<!-- - Researchers should therefore credit the creators of ideas, inventions, work, -->
<!--   and artifacts, and respect copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license -->
<!--   agreements, and other methods of protecting authors' works. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Respect Privacy -->
<!---->
<!-- - The responsibility of respecting privacy applies to machine learning research -->
<!--   in multiple ways. Researchers should be familiar with the various definitions -->
<!--   and forms of privacy and should understand the rights and responsibilities -->
<!--   associated with the collection and use of personal information. -->
<!-- - Data should be used in ways consistent with their licenses. Researchers should -->
<!--   only use personal information for legitimate ends (e.g., those consistent with -->
<!--   approval from an ethics review board) and without violating the rights of -->
<!--   individuals and groups. -->
<!-- - The ethical considerations in this Code should supersede technical legality in -->
<!--   the use of data and technologies, i.e. researchers must go beyond the minimal -->
<!--   ethical requirements (avoid ethics shirking). This requires taking precautions -->
<!--   to prevent re-identification of anonymized data, unauthorized data collection -->
<!--   or data collected without consent, ensuring the continuous accuracy of data, -->
<!--   understanding the provenance of the data, and protecting it from unauthorized -->
<!--   access and accidental disclosure. -->
<!-- - Data should be collected under appropriate ethical approvals and such -->
<!--   approvals must be acknowledged in papers and other contributions. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Honor Confidentiality -->
<!---->
<!-- - Researchers and reviewers are often entrusted with confidential information -->
<!--   such as trade secrets, client data, non-public business strategies, financial -->
<!--   information, research data, pre-publication scholarly articles, and patent -->
<!--   applications. Researchers should protect confidentiality except in cases where -->
<!--   it is evidence of the violation of law, of organizational regulations, or of -->
<!--   the Code. -->
<!-- - In these cases, the nature or contents of that information should not be -->
<!--   disclosed except to appropriate authorities. Researchers should consider -->
<!--   thoughtfully whether such disclosures are consistent with the Code. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Concerns and Remediation -->
<!---->
<!-- This Code should be read in concert with the -->
<!-- [MLRC Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct/). Concerns can be raised regarding any -->
<!-- conduct and contributions that contravene this Code. Where ethical concerns are -->
<!-- raised during the review of research contributions, or in the conduct of -->
<!-- scientific communication and exchange, this Code serves as an additional basis -->
<!-- for remediation of possible violation. MLRC reserves the right to reject and -->
<!-- refuse the presentation of any scientific work found to violate the ethical -->
<!-- guidelines put forth here, at any point. For raising concerns and for -->
<!-- remediation of the same, please reach out to -->
<!-- [reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com](mailto:reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com), -->
<!-- as described in the Code of Conduct. -->
<!---->

<!-- ### Definitions -->
<!---->
<!-- **Research** For the purposes of this Code, "research"[^1]: "... is to be -->
<!-- understood as the original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge -->
<!-- and understanding. It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of -->
<!-- commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship;[^2] -->
<!-- the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artifacts including -->
<!-- design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use -->
<!-- of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or -->
<!-- substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including -->
<!-- design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of -->
<!-- materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national -->
<!-- standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It -->
<!-- also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original -->
<!-- research." -->
<!---->
<!-- **Organizations and Researchers** For the purposes of this Code, "organizations" -->
<!-- refers to any bodies that conduct, host, sponsor or fund research; employ, -->
<!-- support or host researchers; teach research students; or allow research to be -->
<!-- carried out under their auspices. “Researchers” refers to any person who -->
<!-- conducts and contributes to research, including but not limited to: an employee; -->
<!-- an independent contractor or consultant; a research student; a visiting or -->
<!-- emeritus member of staff; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary -->
<!-- contract; or project managers and coordinators. -->
<!---->
<!-- [^1]: by the Research Assessment Exercise (Research Assessment Exercise 2008, -->
<!-- p. 5) -->
<!---->
<!-- [^2]: Scholarship… is defined as the creation, development and maintenance of -->
<!-- the intellectual infrastructure of subjects and disciplines, in forms such as -->
<!-- dictionaries, scholarly editions, catalogues and contributions to major research -->
<!-- databases. -->
