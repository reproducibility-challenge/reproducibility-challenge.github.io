This page lists some useful resources which you can use for the challenge.

## Reproducible Code

Code submission are mandatory for all submitted papers. We recommend that you:

- Publish your code in a repository (e.g. on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and
  anonymize it according to our double blind guidelines.
- Document your code appropriately
- Have a README.md file which describes the exact steps to run your code. You
  can refer to the
  [ML Code Completeness Checklist](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code)
  to write the README file and make sure your code submission is complete.
- See this
  [blog post](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~ksinha4/practices_for_reproducibility/)
  on best practices for reproducibility.

## Compute Resources

- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides free GPU
  backed Jupyter Notebooks
- Instructors can apply for
  [Google Cloud credits](https://cloud.google.com/edu/) for their students.
- If you are a company that can offer cloud computing credits, please contact
  [reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com](reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com)
