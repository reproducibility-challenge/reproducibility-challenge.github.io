This page lists some useful resources which you can use for the challenge.

## Reproducible Code
Code submission are mandatory for all submitted reports. We recommend that you:
- Publish your code in a repository (e.g. on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and anonymize it according to our double blind guidelines.
- Document your code appropriately
- Have a README.md file which describes the exact steps to run your code. You can refer to the [ML Code Completeness Checklist](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code) to write the README file and make sure your code submission is complete.
- See this [blog post](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~ksinha4/practices_for_reproducibility/) on best practices for reproducibility.

## Compute Resources
- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides free GPU backed Jupyter Notebooks
- [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) provides 10hrs/month of GPU accelerated platform free to academics. Code Ocean is a cloud-based research collaboration platform.
- Instructors can apply for [Google Cloud credits](https://cloud.google.com/edu/) for their students. Each student will be given a fixed amount of starter credits to use Google Cloud Compute (GCP).
- Students can also [request credits](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/edu-grants) from Google Cloud Compute.
- If you are a company that can offer cloud computing credits, please contact [reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com](reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com)
