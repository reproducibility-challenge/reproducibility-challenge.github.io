Welcome to the home of ML Reproducibility Challenge. This is an annual event for
providing a space for research into reproducibility of Machine Learning
literature.
([v1](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2018-ReproducibilityChallenge.html),
[v2](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2019-ReproducibilityChallenge.html),
[v3](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/),
[v4](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020),
[v5](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2021),
[v6](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022), [v7](/proceedings/mlrc2023/)). The
primary goal of this event is to encourage the publishing and sharing of
scientific results that are reliable and reproducible. In support of this, the
objective of this challenge is to investigate reproducibility of papers accepted
for publication at top conferences by inviting members of the community at large
to select a paper, and verify the empirical results and claims in the paper by
reproducing the computational experiments, either via a new implementation or
using code/data or other information provided by the authors.
